    "text": "You are right when you urge that we increase our mutual traffic in letters. But the greatest benefit is to be derived from conversation, because it creeps by degrees into the soul. Lectures prepared beforehand and spouted in the presence of a throng have in them more noise but less intimacy. Philosophy is good advice; and no one can give advice at the top of his lungs. Of course we must sometimes also make use of these harangues, if I may so call them, when a doubting member needs to be spurred on; but when the aim is to make a man learn, and not merely to make him wish to learn, we must have recourse to the low-toned words of conversation. They enter more easily, and stick in the memory; for we do not need many words, but, rather, effective words.\nWords should be scattered like seed; no matter how small the seed may be, if it has once found favourable ground, it unfolds its strength and from an insignificant thing spreads to its greatest growth. Reason grows in the same way; it is not large to the outward view, but increases as it does its work. Few words are spoken; but if the mind has truly caught them, they come into their strength and spring up. Yes, precepts and seeds have the same quality; they produce much, and yet they are slight things. Only, as I said, let a favourable mind receive and assimilate them. Then of itself the mind also will produce bounteously in its turn, giving back more than it has received. Farewell."

The request of Lucilius for a cram thus suggests the main topic of the letter, which is taken up in the second paragraph.↩︎\ni.e., the word breviarium, “abridgment,” “abstract,” has displaced the better word summarium, “outline of chief points.”↩︎\ni.e., to do the reading and to review it by means of the summary.

    "text": "The Epicureans, who reduced all goods to “utilities,” could not regard a friend’s advantage as identical with one’s own advantage. And yet they laid great stress upon friendship as one of the chief sources of pleasure. For an attempt to reconcile these two positions see Cicero, De Finibus, i. 65 ff. Seneca has inadvertently used a phrase that implies a difference between a friend’s interests and one’s own. This leads him to reassert the Stoic view of friendship, which adopted as its motto κοινὰ τὰ τῶν φίλων.↩︎\nThe sides are given in reverse order in the two clauses: to the Stoic the terms “friend” and “man” are co-extensive; he is the friend of everybody, and his motive in friendship is to be of service; the Epicurean, however, narrows the definition of “friend” and regards him merely as an instrument to his own happiness.↩︎\nIn this paragraph Seneca exposes the folly of trying to prove a truth by means of logical tricks, and offers a caricature of those which were current among the philosophers whom he derides.↩︎\nLiterally, “or if or if not,” words constantly employed by the logicians and in legal instruments.

If the statement was false, or the claim excessive, the plaintiff lost his case; under certain conditions (see last sentence of Seneca § 11) the defendant could claim annulment of the formula and have the case tried again. Such cases were not lost on their merits, and for that reason the lawyer who purposely took such an advantage was doing a contemptible thing.↩︎\nVergil, Aeneid, ix. 641.↩︎"

    "text": "I received your letter many months after you had posted it; accordingly, I thought it useless to ask the carrier what you were busied with. He must have a particularly good memory if he can remember that! But I hope by this time you are living in such a way that I can be sure what it is you are busied with, no matter where you may be. For what else are you busied with except improving yourself every day, laying aside some error, and coming to understand that the faults which you attribute to circumstances are in yourself? We are indeed apt to ascribe certain faults to the place or to the time; but those faults will follow us, no matter how we change our place.\nYou know Harpasté, my wife’s female clown; she has remained in my house, a burden incurred from a legacy. I particularly disapprove of these freaks; whenever I wish to enjoy the quips of a clown, I am not compelled to hunt far; I can laugh at myself. Now this clown suddenly became blind. The story sounds incredible, but I assure you that it is true: she does not know that she is blind. She keeps asking her attendant to change her quarters; she says that her apartments are too dark.\nYou can see clearly that that which makes us smile in the case of Harpasté happens to all the rest of us; nobody understands that he is himself greedy, or that he is covetous. Yet the blind ask for a guide, while we wander without one, saying: “I am not self-seeking; but one cannot live at Rome in any other way. I am not extravagant, but mere living in the city demands a great outlay. It is not my fault that I have a choleric disposition, or that I have not settled down to any definite scheme of life; it is due to my youth.”\nWhy do we deceive ourselves? The evil that afflicts us is not external, it is within us, situated in our very vitals; for that reason we attain soundness with all the more difficulty, because we do not know that we are diseased.\nSuppose that we have begun the cure; when shall we throw off all these diseases, with all their virulence? At present, we do not even consult the physician, whose work would be easier if he were called in when the complaint was in its early stages. The tender and the inexperienced minds would follow his advice if he pointed out the right way.\nNo man finds it difficult to return to nature, except the man who has deserted nature. We blush to receive instruction in sound sense; but, by Heaven, if we think it base to seek a teacher of this art, we should also abandon any hope that so great a good could be instilled into us by mere chance.\nNo, we must work. To tell the truth, even the work is not great, if only, as I said, we begin to mould and reconstruct our souls before they are hardened by sin. But I do not despair even of a hardened sinner.\nThere is nothing that will not surrender to persistent treatment, to concentrated and careful attention; however much the timber may be bent, you can make it straight again. Heat unbends curved beams, and wood that grew naturally in another shape is fashioned artificially according to our needs. How much more easily does the soul permit itself to be shaped, pliable as it is and more yielding than any liquid! For what else is the soul than air in a certain state? And you see that air is more adaptable than any other matter, in proportion as it is rarer than any other.\nThere is nothing, Lucilius, to hinder you from entertaining good hopes about us, just because we are even now in the grip of evil, or because we have long been possessed thereby. There is no man to whom a good mind comes before an evil one. It is the evil mind that gets first hold on all of us. Learning virtue means unlearning vice.\nWe should therefore proceed to the task of freeing ourselves from faults with all the more courage because, when once committed to us, the good is an everlasting possession; virtue is not unlearned. For opposites find difficulty in clinging where they do not belong, therefore they can be driven out and hustled away; but qualities that come to a place which is rightfully theirs abide faithfully. Virtue is according to nature; vice is opposed to it and hostile.\nBut although virtues, when admitted, cannot depart and are easy to guard, yet the first steps in the approach to them are toilsome, because it is characteristic of a weak and diseased mind to fear that which is unfamiliar. The mind must, therefore, be forced to make a beginning; from then on, the medicine is not bitter; for just as soon as it is curing us it begins to give pleasure. One enjoys other cures only after health is restored, but a draught of philosophy is at the same moment wholesome and pleasant. Farewell."

Ep. ix. 5. The “form” of Aristotle goes back to the “idea” of Plato. These four causes are the causes of Aristotle, – matter (ὕλη), form (εἶδος), force (τὸ κινοῦν), and the end (τὸ τέλος); when they all concur, we pass from possibility to fact. Aristotle gives eight categories in Phys. 225 b 5; and ten in Categ. 1 b 25, – substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, situation, possession, action, passion. For a definition of εἶδος see Aristotle, Phys. 190 b 20 γίγνεται πᾶν ἔκ τε τοῦ ὑποκειμένου καὶ τῆς μορφῆς (i.e. τοῦ εἴδους).↩︎\nWell-known works of Polyclitus, fifth century B.C.↩︎\nExplaining the derivation of the Greek word, – ιδεῖν, “to behold.” For a discussion of Plato’s “ideas,” those “independent, separate, self-existing, perfect, and eternal essences” (Republic vi. and vii.) see Adam, The Republic of Plato, ii. 168-179. According to Adam, Plato owes his theory of ideas to Socrates, the Eleatics, and the study of geometry; but his debt is not so great as his discovery.↩︎\ni.e., the four categories as established by Aristotle, plus the “idea” of Plato.↩︎\nThe Stoic view (see § 2 of this letter), besides making the four categories of “substance,” “form,” “variety,” and “variety of relation,” regarded material things as the only things which possessed being. The Stoics thus differ from Aristotle and Plato in holding that nothing is real except matter; besides, they relate everything to one ultimate cause, the acting force or efficient cause.↩︎\ni.e., the λόγος σπερματικός, the creative force in nature, that is, Providence, or the will of Zeus.↩︎\ni.e., restate the question and hear the evidence again.↩︎\nAccording to the Stoics the soul, which consisted of fire or breath and was a part of the divine essence, rose at death into the ether and became one with the stars. Seneca elsewhere (Consolatio ad Marciam) states that the soul went through a sort of purifying process, – a view which may have had some influence on Christian thought. The souls of the good, the Stoics maintained, were destined to last until the end of the world, the souls of the bad to be extinguished before that time.↩︎\nThe sequence of elements from the earth outwards and upwards was earth, water, air, and fire. The upper fire was ether. Zeno (quoted by Cicero, Acad. i. 11. 39) refused to acknowledge a fifth essence: statuebat enim ignem esse ipsam naturam, quae quaeque gigneret, et mentem et sensus.↩︎\nThe “prison of the body” is a frequent figure in Stoic as in all philosophy. See, for example, § 16 of this letter, “the soul in bondage.”↩︎\nA restatement of the previous remark made in this letter; see note on § 11.↩︎"

    "text": "The regular round of education, ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία, including grammar, music, geometry, arithmetic, astrology, and certain phases of rhetoric and dialectic, are in this letter contrasted with liberal studies – those which have for their object the pursuit of virtue. Seneca is thus interpreting studia liberalia in a higher sense than his contemporaries would expect. Compare J. R. Lowell’s definition of a university, “a place where nothing useful is taught.”↩︎\nGrammaticus in classical Greek means “one who is familiar with the alphabet”; in the Alexandrian age a “student of literature”; in the Roman age the equivalent of litteratus. Seneca means here a “specialist in linguistic science.”↩︎\ni.e., philosophy (virtue).↩︎\nThis theory was approved by Democritus, Hippias of Elis, and the allegorical interpreters; Xenophanes, Heraclitus, and Plato himself condemned Homer for his supposed unphilosophic fabrications.↩︎\nThe tria genera bonorum of Cicero’s De Fin v. 84. Cf. ib. 18, where the three proper objects of man’s search are given as the desire for pleasure, the avoidance of pain, and the attainment of such natural goods as health, strength, and soundnesss of mind. The Stoics held that the good was absolute.↩︎\nSummers compares Lucian, Gall. 17. Seneca, however, does not take such gossip seriously.↩︎\nThis sentence alludes to Calypso, Circe, the Cyclops, and the Sirens.↩︎\nUnfavourable comment by Lycophron, and by Cicero, De Nat. Deor. iii. 22 (Mercurius) ex quo et Penelopa Pana natum ferunt.↩︎\nWith acutae and graves supply voces.↩︎\nPerhaps the equivalent of a “minor.”↩︎\ni.e., for a certain term of years; see R. W. Leage, Roman Private Law, pp. 133 ff. Compare also Lucretius iii. 971, and Horace, Ep. ii. 2. 159.↩︎\nVergil, Georg. i. 336 f.↩︎\nSaturn and Mars were regarded as unlucky stars. Astrology, which dates back beyond 3000 B.C. in Babylonia, was developed by the Greeks of the Alexandrian age and got a foothold in Rome by the second century B.C., flourished greatly under Tiberius. Cf. Horace, Od. i. 11. 1 f.; Juv. iii. 42 f., and F. Cumont, Astrology and Religion among the Greeks and Romans (trans.), esp. pp. 68 ff. and 84 ff.↩︎\nVergil, Georg. i. 424 ff.↩︎\nAn allusion to the sand and oil of the wrestling-ring.↩︎\nCf. Ep. xv. 3 copia ciborum subtilitas inpeditur.↩︎\nIn a strict sense; not, as in § 2, as Seneca thinks that the term should really be defined – the “liberal” study, i.e. the pursuit of wisdom.↩︎\nFor the πρώτη ἀγωγή see Quintilian, ii. 1. 4.↩︎\nFrom what work of Posidonius Seneca is here quoting we do not know; it may perhaps be from the Προτρεπτικά, or Exhortations, indicating the training preliminary to philosophy.↩︎\nSee note a, p. 348.↩︎\ni.e., mathematics is a department of philosophia naturalis.↩︎\nThis line of argument inversely resembles the criticism by Seneca of Posidonius in Ep. xc. – that the inventions of early science cannot be properly termed a part of philosophy.↩︎\nSee N.Q. i. 4 ff.↩︎\nAccording to Roman law, superficies solo cedit, “the building goes with the ground.”↩︎\nExcept philosophy.↩︎\ni.e., in the more commonly accepted sense of the term.↩︎\nThis usage is a not infrequent one in Latin; cf. Petronius, Sat. 42 neminem nihil boni facere oportet; id. ib. 58; Verg. Ecl. v. 25, etc. See Draeger, Hist. Syn. ii. 75, and Roby, ii. 2246 ff.↩︎\nCf. Epp. xxxi. 6 and lxxxi. 29 aestimare res, de quibus . . . cum rerum natura deliberandum est.↩︎\nThe ancient Stoics defined Time as “extension of the world’s motion.” The seasons were said to be “alive” because they depended on material conditions. But the Stoics really acknowledged Time to be immaterial. The same problem of corporeality was discussed with regard to the “good.”↩︎\nCompare the schoolmaster of Juvenal (vii. 234 ff.), who must know: “Nutricem Anchisae, nomen patriamque novercae. Anchemoli, dicat quot Acestes vixerit annis, etc.,” and Friedländer’s note.↩︎\nA tradition, probably begun by the Greek comic writers, and explained by Professor Smyth (Greek Melic Poets, pp. 227 f.) as due to the more independent position of women among the Aeolians. [Wikisource: Gummere has euphemistically translated Seneca here. The Latin is “in his an Sappho publica fuerit”, and the feminine noun “publica” means “public woman”, i.e. a courtesan or prostitute. So Gummere’s translation “whether Sappho was a bad lot” is more accurately rendered as “whether Sappho was a prostitute.”]↩︎\nMarking supposedly spurious lines by the obelus, and using other signs to indicate variations, repetitions, and interpolations. He paid special attention to Homer, Pindar, Hesiod, and the tragedians.↩︎\nThe geometricians drew their figures in the dust or sand.↩︎\nOriginally, rhapsodists who recited from Homer; in general, “interpreters and admirers – in short, the whole ‘spiritual kindred’ – of Homer” (D. B. Monro)↩︎\nAn ancient explanation of the (now disproved) authorship by Homer of such poems as the Cypria, Little Iliad, Sack of Troy, etc.↩︎\nIn other words, the unchangeable, perfect Being of the universe is contrasted with the mutable Non-Being of opinion and unreality.↩︎\ni.e., the universe.↩︎"

    "text": "Cf. Plato, Crito 48, “not life itself, but a good life, is chiefly to be desired.”↩︎\nCompare the “knowledge of things divine and things human” of lxxxix. 5.↩︎\nThe “Golden Age” motif was a frequent one in Latin literature. Compare, e.g., Tibullus, i. 3. 35 ff., the passage beginning: “Quam bene Saturno vivebant rege, priusquam. Tellus in longas est patefacta vias!”↩︎\nWhile modern philosophy would probably side with Seneca rather than with Posidonius, it is interesting to know the opinion of Macaulay, who holds (Essay on Bacon) that there is much in common between Posidonius and the English inductive philosopher, and thinks but little of Seneca’s ideas on the subject. Cf. W. C. Summers, Select Letters of Seneca, p. 312.↩︎\nCleobulus of Rhodes, Periander of Corinth, Pittacus of Mitylene, Bias of Priene, Thales of Miletus, Chilon of Sparta, and Solon of Athens. For some of these substitutions are made in certain lists.↩︎\nCf. Ep. lxxxviii. 20 ad alia multum, ad virtutem nihil.↩︎\nVergil, Georg. i. 144.↩︎\nCf. Juvenal, iii. 254 ff.: “Longa coruscat. Serraco veniente abies, atque altera pinum. Plaustra vehunt, nutant alte populoque minantur.” Compare also the “towering tenements” of § 8.↩︎\nVergil, Georg. i. 139 f.↩︎\nCf. T. Rice Holmes, Ancient Britain, pp. 121 f., who concludes that the discovery of ore-smelting was accidental.↩︎\nCf. Diog. Laert. vi. 37 θεασάμενός ποτε παιδίον ταῖς χερσὶ ἐξέῤῥιψε τῆς πήρας τὴν κοτύλην, εἰπών, Παιδίον με νενίκηκεν εὐτελεία.↩︎\nCompare the halls of Nero which Seneca may easily have had in mind: (Suet. Nero 31) cenationes laqueatae tabulis eburneis versatilibus . . . praecipua cenationum rotunda, quae perpetuo diebus ac noctibus vice mundi circumageretur.↩︎\nCf. Ovid, Met. i. 121 f.: “Domus antra fuerunt. Et densi frutices et vinctae cortice virgae.” Among many accounts by Roman writers of early man, compare this passage of Ovid, and that in the fifth book of Lucretius.↩︎\nOvid, Met. vi. 55 ff.↩︎\nProfessor Summers calls attention to the similarity of this passage and Cicero, De Nat. Deor. ii. 134 ff. dentibus manditur . . . a lingua adiuvari videtur . . . in alvo . . . calore . . . in reliquum corpus dividantur.↩︎\nBesides lapis specularis (window-glass) the Romans used alabaster, mica, and shells for this purpose.↩︎\nSuetonius tells us that a certain Ennius, a grammarian of the Augustan age, was the first to develop shorthand on a scientific basis, and that Tiro, Cicero’s freedman, had invented the process. He also mentions Seneca as the most scientific and encyclopaedic authority on the subject.↩︎\nPossibly either the manes or the indigitamenta of the early Roman religion.↩︎\ni.e., λόγος.↩︎\nSeneca, himself one of the keenest scientific observers in history (witness the Nat. Quaest., Epp. lvii., lxxix., etc.), is pushing his argument very far in this letter. His message is clear enough; but the modern combination of natural science, psychology, and philosophy shows that Posidonius had some justification for his theories. Cf. also Lucretius, v. 1105-7 ff.↩︎\nThis Scythian prince and friend of Solon, who visited Athens in the sixth century B.C., is also said to have invented the bellows and the anchor. Cf., however, Iliad xviii. 600 f. ὡς ὅτε τις τροχὸν ἄρμενον ἐν παλάμηισιν ἑζόμενος κεραμεὺς πειρήσεται, and Leaf’s comment: “The potter’s wheel was known in pre-Mycenean times, and was a very ancient invention to the oldest Epic poets.” Seneca is right.↩︎\nSeneca (see next sentence) is right again. The arch was known in Chaldaea and in Egypt before 3000 B.C. Greek bee-hive tombs, Etruscan gateways, and early Roman remains, testify to its immemorial use.↩︎\nThe ancients judged precious stones merely by their colour; their smaragdus included also malachite, jade, and several kinds of quartz. Exposure to heat alters the colour of some stones; and the alchemists believed that the “angelic stone” changed common flints into diamonds, rubies, emeralds, etc. See G. F. Kunz, The Magic of Jewels and Charms, p. 16. It was also an ancient superstition that emeralds were produced from jasper.↩︎\ni.e., the Epicureans, who withdrew from civil life and regarded the gods as taking no part in the affairs of men.↩︎\ni.e., live according to nature.↩︎\nVerg. Georg. i. 125 ff.↩︎\nCf. Horace, Ep. i. 10. 20 f.: “Purior in vicis aqua tendit rumpere plumbum. Quam quae per pronum trepidat cum murmure rivum?”↩︎\nBecause virtue depends upon reason, and none but voluntary acts should meet with praise or blame.↩︎"

    "text": "In spite of the centesimus annus of § 14 (q.v.), the most probable date of this letter, based on Tac. Ann. xvi. 13 and other general evidence, is July-September 64 A.D. 58 A.D. would be too early for many reasons – among them that “peace all over the world” would not be a true statement until January of 62. (See the monographs of Jonas, O. Binder, Peiper, and Schultess.)↩︎\nProbably Aebutius Liberalis, to whom the treatise De Beneficiis was dedicated.↩︎\nThat Lyons, situated at the junction of the Arar and the Rhone, was of especial prominence in Gaul, may be also gathered from the fact that it boasted a government mint and the Ara Augusti – a shrine established for the annual worship of all the Gallic states. Moreover, the Emperor Claudius delivered his famous address in that city (see Tac. Ann. xi. 23 f.).↩︎\nCf. Ep. iv. 7, esp. the words noli huic tranquillitati confidere: momento mare evertitur.↩︎\nThe passage bears a striking resemblance to the words of Theseus in an unknown play of Euripides (Nauck, Frag. 964) quoted by Cicero, Tusc. iii. 14. 29, and by Plutarch, Consolation to Apollonius, 112d.↩︎\nSeneca (N.Q. vi. 26) speaks of Paphos (on the island of Cyprus) as having been more than once devastated. We know of two such accidents – one under Augustus and another under Vespasian. See the same passage for other earthquake shocks in various places.↩︎\nLyons held an exceptional position in relation to the three Gallic provinces; it was a free town, belonging to none and yet their capital, much like the city of Washington in relation to the United States.↩︎\nA fact mentioned merely to suggest Rome with her seven hills.↩︎\nFor example, Mycenae and Tiryns.↩︎\nProbably the writer, and intimate friend of Augustus, who began life in Rome as a captive from Egypt. Falling into disfavour with the Emperor, he took refuge with the malcontent Asinius Pollio at Tusculum, and subsequently died in the East. Cf. Seneca, De Ira, iii. 23.↩︎\nIt was in 43 B.C. that Plancus led out the colonists who were chiefly Roman citizens driven from Vienna. Seneca would have been more accurate had he said “one hundred and eighth (or seventh).” Buecheler and Schultess would (unnecessarily) emend to read centesimus septimus. But Seneca was using round numbers.↩︎\nArdea, the earliest capital of Latium, and Rome, the present capital of the empire. Seneca probably refers to Ardea’s capture and destruction by the Samnites in the fourth century; Rome was captured by the Celts in 390 B.C. The former greatness of Ardea was celebrated by Vergil, Aeneid, vii. 411 ff.: “et nunc magnum manet Ardea nomen, Sed fortuna fuit.”↩︎\nSiremps (or sirempse – Plaut. Amph. 73), an ancient legal term, is derived by Festus from similis re ipsa; but Corssen explains it as from sic rem pse.↩︎\ni.e., surveying. See Ep. lxxxviii. 10.↩︎\ni.e., Ὠκεανός, the stream which encircles the earth.↩︎\nThis plain-living, plain-speaking philosopher appears also in Epp. xx. 9 and lxii. 3. Seneca refers to him as seminudum, quanto minus quam stramentis incubantem.↩︎"

In this passage Seneca uses “soul” in its widest sense.↩︎\nCertain of the Peripatetic and Academic school.↩︎\nProbably due to the criticism of the Stoics by Carneades, who said that everything which is according to nature should be classed among the goods.↩︎\nIf we call pleasure a good.↩︎\nCf. § 1 of this letter. Plato gives three divisions – the λογιστικόν, the ἐπιθυμητικόν, and the θυμοειδές which obeys either the first or the second. See his Republic, 440.↩︎\nAeneid, iii. 426 ff.↩︎\n§ 5.↩︎\nAnswering the objection raised in § 14.↩︎\nCf. Ep. lxxi. 16 non intenditur virtus. The Stoic idea of tension may be combined here with the raising of a note to a higher pitch.↩︎\nFrag. 138 Usener. Cf. Sen. Ep. lxvi. 47.↩︎\nVergil, Aeneid, v. 363. Vergil MSS. read pectore.↩︎\ni.e., to participation in the divine existence.↩︎\nVergil, Aeneid, ix. 485.↩︎\nCf. Juvenal, x. 65 Seianus ducitur unco spectandus. The bodies of criminals were dragged by the hook through the city to the Scalae Gemoniae, down which they were flung.↩︎\nFrag. 6 Lunderstedt.↩︎\nThe figure is taken from the Roman dress, – one who was “girt high” (alte cinctus), ready for vigorous walking, being contrasted with the loosely-girdled person (discinctus), indolent or effeminate.

    "text": "You have asked me to give you a Latin word for the Greek sophismata. Many have tried to define the term, but no name has stuck. This is natural, inasmuch as the thing itself has not been admitted to general use by us; the name, too, has met with opposition. But the word which Cicero used seems to me most suitable: he calls them cavillationes.\nIf a man has surrendered himself to them, he weaves many a tricky subtlety, but makes no progress toward real living; he does not thereby become braver, or more restrained, or loftier of spirit.\nHe, however, who has practised philosophy to effect his own cure, becomes high-souled, full of confidence, invincible, and greater as you draw near him. This phenomenon is seen in the case of high mountains, which appear less lofty when beheld from afar, but which prove clearly how high the peaks are when you come near them; such, my dear Lucilius, is our true philosopher, true by his acts and not by his tricks. He stands in a high place, worthy of admiration, lofty, and really great. He does not stretch himself or walk on tiptoe like those who seek to improve their height by deceit, wishing to seem taller than they really are; he is content with his own greatness.\nAnd why should he not be content with having grown to such a height that Fortune cannot reach her hands to it? He is therefore above earthly things, equal to himself under all conditions, – whether the current of life runs free, or whether he is tossed and travels on troubled and desperate seas; but this steadfastness cannot be gained through such hair-splittings as I have just mentioned. The mind plays with them, but profits not a whit; the mind in such cases is simply dragging philosophy down from her heights to the level ground.\nI would not forbid you to practise such exercises occasionally; but let it be at a time when you wish to do nothing. The worst feature, however, that these indulgences present is that they acquire a sort of self-made charm, occupying and holding the soul by a show of subtlety; although such weighty matters claim our attention, and a whole life seems scarcely sufficient to learn the single principle of despising life. “What? Did you not mean ‘control’ instead of ‘despise’”? No; “controlling” is the second task; for no one has controlled his life aright unless he has first learned to despise it. Farewell."
